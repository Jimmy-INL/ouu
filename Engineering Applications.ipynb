This work focuses on the quantification of uncertainties associated with yaw orientation, and wind speeds in wind farm layout optimization with Monte Carlo Methods. An understanding, and proper treatment of these uncertainties will greatly aid in the realization of more robust farm layout designs, ultimately improving the accuracy of annual power output predictions.\n",

    "Uncertain variables are variables that follow a probability distribution, design variables are variables that an optimizer can vary, and parameters are constants. The classification of the variables is problem dependent. For instance, the height of a turbine could be considered as a design variable if we allow the optimizer to vary it, as an uncertain variable if we assume that due to terrain or manufacturing variability the exact height is unknown but follows a particular probability distribution, or as a parameter if we set the turbine height in the model at a fixed value. Another example is the rotor yaw, which can be considered a design variable or a parameter. A tunable parameter of a wake model, such as the wake coefficient expansion, could be\n",
