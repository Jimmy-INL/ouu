    "## Polynomial Chaos\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial chaos (PC) is the name of an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) method that approximates a function with a polynomial expansion made up of orthogonal polynomials. This function has \\textit{random variables} as inputs, and we are interested in the effects of the random (uncertain) inputs on the output of this function. Statistics of the output can describe the effects of the inputs. We use the polynomial chaos method to efficiently compute these statistics and the gradients of these statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first describe the polynomial chaos method for the case of a 1-dimensional random input and then for the $n$-dimensional random input case. We then discuss two methods---quadrature and regression---to compute the coefficients used in the PC expansion. We finish with an extension of polynomial chaos to compute gradients."

Details about the numerical generation of orthogonal polynomials can be found in~\\citet{Padron2017}.

    "Sparse grids is a particular type of quadrature that is based on linear combinations of tensor product quadrature operators that result in a significantly smaller number of nodes (function evaluations) while preserving as high a level of accuracy as tensor product quadrature~\\citep{Gerstner1998,Olivier2010}. The first method to produce sparse grids was proposed by \\citet{Smolyak1963} in the context of multi-dimensional quadrature and interpolation.\n",
    "The sparse grid quadrature method can be written as~\\citep{Eldred2011}\n",

    "where $l$ is the level of the sparse grid ($l \\in \\{0, 1 ,2 , \\ldots \\}$). Increasing the level of the sparse grid increases the number of quadrature points. The indices $i_k$ define which quadrature is used for the $k$ dimension. These indices are grouped in the multi-index $\\mathbf{i}=(i_1,i_2,\\ldots,i_n)$, for which we define $|\\mathbf{i}|=i_1+i_2+ \\cdots +i_n$. The relationship between the index $i_k$ and the number of quadrature points $m_{i_k}$ is called the growth rule and is dependent on the quadrature rule used. If the quadrature points are chosen based on a nested quadrature rule, then a nonlinear growth rule results, which approximately doubles $m_{i_k}$ with every increment in $i_k$ (e.g., $m_{i_k}=2^{i_k+1}-1$). If the quadrature points are based on a non-nested quadrature rule, then a linear growth rule results, which allows for finer granularity in the number of points used (e.g., $m_{i_k}=2i_k+1$).\n",
